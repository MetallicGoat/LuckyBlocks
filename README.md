# LuckyBlocks
A total mess as of now

## TODO:
- Drops System (Support for 3 types; Material, Special Item, Custom)
- Arena whitelist/blacklist
- 3 configs (Main, LuckyBlock Types, Drops)
- No-go place areas
- Improve mechanics of the block itself
- More user-friendly (Wrong command/Config Issue)
- More useful commands
- Possibly add support for legacy MC versions
